Changes for hapi version 2015
+ Improve parser (more expressive, better error messages)
+ Implement compilation from hapi to C++
+ Implement host language statements
+ Start stdlib
+ Implement automated program optimization (target parallelism)

Future plans:
+ Implement compiler for synchronous operations (sync, guisync and guivalue)
+ Implement debugger (werbservice created by compile-option)
+ Multichannel waiting (waiting on more than one channel, any channel can activate process)
+ Parametrically polymorphic types
+ Performance optimizations
  + Counting active processes (options)
    - System call (if one exists)
    - If decrementing directly followed by incrementing (and vice versa), erase both
  + More channel types (see seperate item)
+ Multiple channel types (options)
  + FIFO (existing)
  + TCP (using tcp connections, enables multi computer processing)
  + IPC-SYSV (SYS-V ipc mesage passing, more efficient?)
  + IPC-POSIX (POSIX ipc mesage passing, more efficient?)
  + IPC-LINUX (Linux native ipc mesage passing, more efficient?)
+ Enable non tail-recursive method calls (merge pi-calculus with lambda-calculus)
+ Regular expression types
+ Regular expression native library (written in hapi)
+ Byte level protocols (define protocol syntax to support existing protocols)
+ Session types with named participants (alice and bob as opposed to 1 and 2)
+ Bootstrapped compiler (written in hapi)
