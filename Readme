INTRODUCTION:
This is the hapi (Happy Asynchronous PI-calculus) library - which implements a
parser for the language, type checking and compilation. This is used by the
hapi compiler.

This software is written by Lasse Nielsen(lasse.nielsen.dk<at>gmail<dot>com),
and distributed under the GNU GPL v.3 or later.

This means that it is perfectly legal to use, share, study and develop this
software, as long as the same rights are given for the derived products.

Information about the GNU GPL can be found at the Free Software Foundation
(www.fsf.org) or more specifically at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

INSTALLATION:
To install the library, make sure the dependancies are installed, and then type
-make config
-make build
-sudo make install
This will install the library.

To install the hapi compiler (and interpreter) go to the programs folder and
write:
-make config
-make build
-sudo make install

To test the installation simply write
-hapi -check ''
This should typecheck and run the trivial (terminates imediately) program.
Example programs are in the examples folder, and can be compiled with the
command
- make build
or
- make example
which compiles the file <example>.pi to the executable <example>.

- Enjoy!
